We strive to continuously update and improve this material and would appreciate any feedback. You can reach us at ocdnet.support@webcbt.se or talk to us in person at a training session. 1.1 Description of OCD-NET and BDD-NET OCD-NET and BDD-NET are therapist-guided internet-based cognitive behaviour (ICBT) therapies for OCD and BDD, respectively. In ICBT, patients have an identified therapist providing support and feedback throughout treatment. All contact with the therapist occurs through the treatment platform as asynchronous text messages (like e-mail or SMS). 1.2 Type of treatment The intended use of OCD-NET and BDD-NET are within a stepped care model as an alternative to brief individual CBT, group CBT, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or higher-intensity CBT for adults with mild to moderate symptoms. The treatments are expected to be cost-saving compared to individual CBT (10 hours or more intensive treatment) but not compared to group CBT. Crucially, ICBT therapies typically require less therapist time per patient (10-20 minutes per patient each week) and could therefore release therapist time compared to individual CBT or group CBT. 1.3 Background Both OCD-NET and BDD-NET were initially developed by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. OCD-NET has been evaluated in six clinical trials to date with results indicating that it is as effective as regular face-to-face CBT, while requiring less therapist time per patient and with the advantage of being accessible from any device connected to the internet (Andersson et al. 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015; Rück et al. 2018). Similarly, BDD-NET has been evaluated in two clinical trials with comparable results (Enander et al. 2014, 2016). Both treatments were initially developed in Swedish but have been translated to English and evaluated in pilot studies in New York (OCD-NET) and an international pilot study (BDD-NET) (Patel et al. 2017). 1.4 Tasks for Kristin As therapist: Log in as therapist 1 Write a message to patient 1 Review homework module 3 for patient 1 Remove a suicidality flag and comment “Suicide risk assessment completed via telephone.

We generally recommend that you use the platform while reading this manual, to test features as you go along. 2.2 Platform use overview There are five common scenarios during the course of treatment: Responding to messages Reviewing homework Opening new treatment modules Reviewing questionnaires Responding to warning flags These actions can all be accessed in the participant overview, shown below: A typical day as a therapist includes responding to one or more messages, reviewing homework and opening up a new module. Once in a while therapists contact inactive patients or assess a warning flag. Quick note: We use Participant and Patient as synonyms here. 2.3 Navigation The majority of day to day tasks are accessed via the Participant search menu. The menu is located at the left-hand side of the browser window, and clicking Participant search will get you back to the participant overview. To access individual participants, click the pencil next to their name. This menu may expand depending on administrative rights. Other parts of the menu include administrative settings such as editing treatment content, editing assessments, changing the way flags appear, and changing settings to the site itself. These will not be relevant to most therapists and we do not cover them in detail here. Just remember that you can always go back to the default view by navigating to Participant search in the left-hand menu. 2.4 Filtering the participant overview To get a quick overview of a long participant list, filter patients that meet certain criteria, for example belonging to certain groups in treatment of certain treatments. There is a button called Selection above the participant list. We recommend that therapists use the “My participants” filter to show only patients assigned to them. 2.5 Writing and responding to messages A new message from a patient will be indicated by this icon turning red . Navigate to Treatments -&gt; participant messages to view the message and write a response. See the chapter Being an effective ICBT therapist for guidelines on how to write messages. 2.6 Homework review A completed homework assignment is shown in the Homework column in the participant overview. Click the pencil next to the participant and navigate to Treatments -&gt; Treatment access to review the homework and mark it as completed. Completed homework assignments will show up for review in the treatment overview Internet-based CBT relies heavily on self-directed activities and homework review is a good time to check whether the patient has grasped important concepts and are able to apply them to their own situation. 2.7 Treatment modules When a patient has read a module and completed the corresponding homework assignment(s), they are ready for the next module. To grant access to a new module, navigate to Treatments -&gt; Treatment access and check the box next to the next module. A date will appear next to the module indicating when the module was activated. Patients automatically get a text message when they get access to a new module. Check the box to the left to open a new module The number of modules and weeks in treatment varies between treatment protocols but a rough guideline is that patients should progress through one module per week. Some treatment techniques, like exposure with response prevention, are spread out across several modules to emphasise their importance and give participants sufficient time to get started on the technique. 2.8 Questionnaires Before, during, and after treatment, patients are asked to fill out questionnaires. When new questionnaires are activated they appear as the patient logs onto the platform. Therapists can review and change which questionnaires should appear at which day in Assessments but we recommend that therapists stick to the standard schedule whenever possible. Questionnaires for each patient are listed in this view, click the paper icon to view responses 2.9 Warning flags The ICBT platform will display a warning flag next to a patient’s name for certain events. The most common flags are due to inactivity or non-response to questionnaires. These serve as prompts to therapists to take further action, for example reaching out by phone to a patient or sending them another text message reminder. Once a warning flag has been noticed and dealt with, indicate the action taken in the temporary flag text box in the Participant stats tab (shown below). Please note, however that inactivity flags automatically disappear once then patient uses the platform again. Temporary flag texts aid communication between therapists when they manage flags 2.9.1 Common warning flags Patient has not logged in for 7 days: Patient has not written a message in 7 days: Patient has not responded to measurement in time: Patient has no assigned therapist: Treatment ends within 1 week: Treatment has ended: 2.9.2 Suicidality warning flags The most important type of warning flag is due to heightened suicidality. The platform is configured to display this flag if a patient responds 2 or 3 on the suicidality question in PHQ-9. Warning flag to indicate suicidal ideation: Local clinical guidelines may overrule the general course of action outlined here. Call the patient immediately Explain that it is standard procedure to call when a patient indicates heightened suicidal ideation Follow a hierarchy of questions, such as M.I.N.I. interview, to assess level of suicidality If the immediate risk is low (i.e. PHQ-9 score of 2), make an agreement to check back in with the patient in a few days and give them contact information to the nearest 24-hour psychiatric care unit If the immediate risk is high (i.e. PHQ-9 score of 3), advise the patient to seek immediate help at your centre or at a 24-hour psychiatric care unit. Once the level of suicidality is deemed to be low enough to not require further attention, therapists can remove the warning flag under the Flags tab for the participant. Flags are listed under the Flags tab, click on the pencil to edit flag. Once you have managed a flag, you can make a note that lists actions taken, and remove the flag. 2.10 Supervision Supervision through the platform makes it easy to connect feedback from the supervisor to specific therapist messages and actions. The supervision page is found at Treatment -&gt; Supervision messages for each participant. 2.11 Assign new therapist The most typical scenario is that each patient is treated by one therapist throughout treatment, but it is not uncommon for a second therapist to act as backup if the primary therapist is not available. To assign another therapist or change therapist, navigate to the patient in question and click the Participant stats tab. At the bottom of that page, there is a list of therapists and those assigned to the patient will have a checkmark next to them. Simply un-check whoever is to be removed and check whoever is to be assigned the patient. The number 2 next to Oskar Flygare indicates that he is assigned to 2 patients 2.12 Create new patient login To create a new patient login on the platform, go to the participant overview by selecting Participant search in the left-hand menu. Select Create new participant at the bottom of the participant list. Fields not needed are: Participant ID: Internal ID for the platform. Usually not needed. Password: New patient logins are created without passwords. The first time the patient logs onto the platform they will be asked to generate a password Temporary flag text: Usually not needed at creation but might come in handy later for communicating between therapists Temporary notes: Usually not needed 2.13 OCD-NET and BDD-NET for patients We encourage therapists using OCD-NET and BDD-NET to login with one of the test patient accounts to see what the platform looks like for patients. See below for a quick overview of the registration process. 2.13.1 Access Patients access the platform from the Patient-URL, which is different from the therapist URL. Patients can click the “I lost my password” text to receive a new password. 2.13.2 Using the technology as a patient Landing page for patients The landing page for patients includes basic information about the treatment, whether they have been granted access to new modules or have received new messages. In the menu bar at the top of the page, patients can easily navigate the platform, view treatment content, report problems, and see the Privacy Notice. Messages in the patient platform Module text Homework assignments Worksheets, patients click the + sign to add new tabs with information Patients can report problems, which will display as a flag in the therapist view "],
["ocd-net-therapist-manual.html", "Chapter 3 OCD-NET therapist manual 3.1 What is OCD-NET? 3.2 Closing remarks", " Chapter 3 OCD-NET therapist manual 3.1 What is OCD-NET? The treatment in OCD-NET is based on established treatment protocols for OCD (Foa, Yadin, and Lichner 2012), and focuses on exposure with response prevention (ERP). This means patients do most of the active treatment work away from their computer or mobile device, for example when they are performing exposure and response prevention exercises. 3.1.1 Who is suitable for OCD-NET OCD-NET has been developed to treat adult patients with OCD. In previous trials evaluating OCD-NET, participants have had comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety, while autism spectrum disorder, psychotic symptoms and substance use disorder have been exclusion criteria. The intended use of OCD-NET is within a stepped-care model where patients are offered low-intensity treatments as a first step, see the NICE-guidelines. We therefore recommend that OCD-NET is primarily used for patients with mild to moderate symptom severity without comorbid autism spectrum disorder, psychotic symptoms, or substance use disorder. 3.1.2 Presenting OCD-NET as an option to the patient It is important to stress that previous trials of OCD-NET have been conducted on patients that have actively requested internet-based treatment when giving this option. Thus, forcing someone to undertake a treatment they do not agree with is unhelpful at the very least and can also be harmful. With that in mind, we believe there are two particularly strong arguments for the use of OCD-NET rather than face-to-face therapy: patients can access the treatment content and therapist therapist support whenever they want to, and treatment can start right away rather than after a waiting time. We have also found that many patients like to contribute to research and the development of new treatments. For example, most patients will see the benefit of evaluating remote treatment options. Other suggestions: Write your first message on the first day of treatment to welcome the patient and notify them of ways to contact you with questions Provide encouragement throughout treatment to motivate the patient and establish a therapeutic working alliance 3.1.3 Modules in OCD-NET There are 10 modules in OCD-NET, which patients are expected to complete in 12 weeks. Each module consists of texts and uses well established evidence based interventions for OCD, with exposure and response prevention (ERP) being the core intervention. To progress to the next module participants have to complete homework assignments (such as reading text material, answering a quiz at the end of each module, completing worksheets, or report about ERP exercises) which are viewed by their therapist. Treatment module Content 1. Introduction to the treatment Introduction to CBT Information about OCD 2. A CBT model of OCD Psychological model of OCD with patient examples 3. Thinking mistakes in OCD Common cognitive biases and unhelpful interpretations of thoughts in OCD 4. Introduction to ERP Goal setting Planning ERP exercises 5. More about ERP Best practices in ERP 6. Imaginal exposure Instructions to get started with imaginal exposures 7. Re-exposure Undoing habitual compulsions 8. Difficulties during treatment Common problems in ERP Motivation traps 9. Long term goals and values Increasing valued behaviours Aligning ERP exercises with long term values 10. Summary and wrap up Maintaining progress Relapse prevention We view modules 1, 2, 4, and 5 as the core modules in OCD-NET. Modules 1 and 2 consist of two essential features: the patient needs to report at least some intrusions/compulsions in the OCD diary, and the patient needs to understand the CBT model of OCD. These two features are the building blocks for the subsequent ERP exercises in module 4 and 5. We usually recommend patients to do modules 1-5 in a relatively quick pace in order to get to the active treatment as soon as possible. It is not crucial to have a detailed plan for each ERP exercise before starting; you should encourage patients to get started and fine-tune ERP exercises as they go along. You can consider modules 3 and 6 as optional for the patient. We advise all our patients to read the text in module 3 (thinking mistakes), but if the patient does not feel that this cognitive intervention is relevant for them, we proceed directly to module 4 (ERP). Module 6 (imaginal exposure) may be beneficial for some patients but our experience is that many patients skip this intervention. Although the text is written from a habituation lens, we often tell our patients that imaginal exposure may be a tool to learn that having a thought or image is not the same as acting that way, and to tolerate uncertainty. The number of completed modules is not an essential predictor of treatment outcomes in OCD-NET. We have two goals only: get the patient to module 5 and get the patient to do a lot of ERP exercises. Thus it is not essential that the patient progress through all modules as long as he/she does ERP and reports this frequently to the therapist. Patients will gain access to all modules at the end of treatment, and will be able to log onto the platform for one year after completing the OCD-NET treatment. Thus, the role of the therapist is to encourage the patient to do ERP exercises and help them to design and evaluate ERP exercises effectively. Modules 6-9 can be opened in any order to fit the needs of each patient. For example, a patient might not have any use of imaginal exposure but finds that they have a hard time refraining from habitual compulsions. In that case, you may open up module 7 (re-exposure) instead of module 6 (imaginal exposure). Other patients may struggle with ERP exercises and will find module 8 (difficulties during the treatment) useful. Use your clinical intuition. 3.2 Closing remarks We hope that you have found this therapist guide useful. Our goal has been to present a few ideas about how to deliver OCD-NET effectively. These are just the first building blocks and you will likely find that adaptations are needed to your particular patients and your own style as a therapist. We strive to continuously update and improve this material and would appreciate any feedback. You can reach us at ocdnet.support@webcbt.se or talk to us in person at a training session. "],
["bdd-net-therapist-manual.html", "Chapter 4 BDD-NET therapist manual 4.1 What is BDD-NET? 4.2 Who is suitable for BDD-NET 4.3 Presenting BDD-NET as an option to the patient 4.4 Modules in BDD-NET 4.5 Closing remarks", " Chapter 4 BDD-NET therapist manual 4.1 What is BDD-NET? BDD-NET consists of eight interactive modules and focuses on exposure with response prevention (ERP). This means that patients do most of the active treatment work away from their computer or mobile device, for example when they are performing ERP exercises. 4.2 Who is suitable for BDD-NET BDD-NET is developed to treat adults with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Patients may have comorbid conditions, for example other anxiety disorders, depression, or OCD. Patients may also take antidepressant medication during the course of treatment. We recommend that patients do not change the dose during the course of treatment. BDD-NET may also be delivered to patients with any level of BDD symptom severity. Contraindications include having a personality disorder that might interfere with treatment (such as borderline personality disorder), psychotic symptoms, an ongoing substance abuse, or acute suicidal ideation. BDD-NET is text-based and so requires sufficient reading skills and understanding of English. We recommend that the patient is referred to face-to-face treatments if contraindications are discovered. 4.3 Presenting BDD-NET as an option to the patient 4.3.1 Assessing insight Participating in internet-based treatments such as BDD-NET is voluntary, and therapists need to make sure that patients are willing to challenge their BDD in treatment. Lack of insight is common in BDD and BDD-NET is designed to work for patients that express varying degrees of insight. It is our experience that patients need to at least be willing to try out alternative behaviours during the course of treatment, even if they might still be convinced that their appearance concerns are justified at the start of treatment. 4.3.2 Managing expectations Some patients may have expectations to be completely free from anxiety after BDD-NET, and that all that is required of them is to read and understand what is written in the treatment modules. Such expectations are discussed in module 4 (goal setting) but therapists are advised to assess whether patients are willing to challenge their BDD through exposure with response prevention and try out alternative behaviours before starting BDD-NET. If someone completely refuses to try new behaviours they are unlikely to participate in BDD-NET fully and benefit from the treatment. 4.3.3 A good start in BDD-NET Many patients with BDD find BDD-NET an interesting treatment option, particularly those who avoid many activities due to their appearance concerns. The strongest arguments in favour of ICBT treatments like BDD-NET, from a patient perspective, is that the treatment content and the therapist are accessible throughout the week, and that the treatment starts promptly after evaluation rather than after a time in waiting list. To give patients a positive first impression of the treatment, we suggest that therapists write their first message on the first day of treatment to welcome the patient and notify them of ways to contact you. Provide encouragement throughout treatment to motivate the patient and establish a therapeutic working alliance. Patients sometimes struggle with crucial treatment components such as the BDD diary exposure with response prevention (ERP), so make sure to provide extra support if patients get stuck at those points. 4.4 Modules in BDD-NET Below is an overview of the eight treatment modules. We recommend that you look at them from a patient’s point of view before starting the first treatment. Treatment module Content 1. Introduction to BDD and the treatment An introduction to BDD Introduction to the treatment content 2. A CBT model of BDD Psychological explanation of the link between thoughts, emotions, and behaviours 3. Interpretation traps Common cognitive biases in BDD 4. Introduction to ERP Goal setting and planning of exposure with response prevention 5. More about ERP Doing and evaluating exposure with response prevention exercises 6. Values and Goals Identifying and acting in accordance with personal values 7. Difficulties during treatment Strategies to deal with common difficulties and setbacks 8. Summary and Relapse Prevention Treatment summary, evaluation of treatment, and designing a relapse prevention plan As you can see, the emphasis is on doing exposure with response prevention (ERP), which we view as the main component of BDD-NET. You typically want to encourage the patient to progress through the first three modules as fast as possible, check that they have understood the rationale for ERP, and then start doing ERP. Once a patient is doing regular ERP-exercises, you can open up modules 6-7 for them to complete while continuing to do daily ERP. Module 8 can then be opened up with one to two weeks left in treatment. 4.5 Closing remarks The strategies outlined here should be viewed as the first building blocks in becoming an effective ICBT therapist using BDD-NET. As in regular clinical practice, we recommend continuous supervision and that therapists discuss difficult cases with colleagues. We strive to continuously update and improve this material and would appreciate any feedback. You can reach us at ocdnet.support@webcbt.se or talk to us in person at a training session. "],
["being-an-effective-icbt-therapist.html", "Chapter 5 Being an effective ICBT therapist 5.1 Keep your messages short 5.2 Write often 5.3 Therapists and the rest of the content in ICBT 5.4 Promoting hands-on ERP exercises 5.5 Lack of therapist-guided exposure exercises 5.6 Dealing with patients with low engagement", " Chapter 5 Being an effective ICBT therapist Being a therapist in internet-based CBT (ICBT) differs in several ways from regular face-to-face treatment. The first difference is the mode of communication: asynchronous text messages rather than live face-to-face talking. The second is that therapists are more closely integrated in the treatment content, and will rely more heavily on the written material. Third, there is less therapist oversight during active ERP exercises. We will discuss these implications below. 5.1 Keep your messages short Messages should be concise and to the point but still using a personal touch. The main aim is to provide encouragement and reinforce key behaviours in the treatment, such as registrations in the OCD/BDD diary and performing ERP exercises. There are some exceptions to this rule. Therapists are advised to write longer messages when needed: to highlight examples in the diary that are informative and relate these to the CBT model of OCD/BDD, or to provide encouragement by linking ERP exercises to a patient’s long-term goals and values. 5.2 Write often Frequent communication is particularly useful at the start of treatment and when patients are in the startup phase of ERP. In many ways, ICBT may be an even more intensive treatment than traditional face-to-face CBT for patients. Our standard procedure is to contact patients at least twice weekly, but more often when needed. For example, therapists may confirm an exposure exercise in the morning and check in during the afternoon for a follow-up. There are exceptions to the rule of frequent messages: some patients will prefer to do ERP exercises on their own and will not have many questions. This is perfectly fine; some patients benefit greatly from the ICBT treatment without the therapist support. 5.3 Therapists and the rest of the content in ICBT As previously mentioned, ICBT is in many ways a high intensity treatment. Patients not only respond to messages but also read module texts, answer homework questions and questionnaires, and fill in worksheets. The treatment becomes particularly intensive once patients start performing daily ERP exercises. Thus, what might feel like a low-intensity treatment from the therapist perspective is actually be very intensive for patients. Therapists should keep in mind that patients do many other things besides writing and responding to messages. Corrective feedback is sometimes necessary in order to design, do, and evaluate effective ERP exercises. We recommend that therapists are generally restrictive about corrective feedback when it is not clearly needed for ERP, but therapists should use their clinical judgment in these situations. 5.4 Promoting hands-on ERP exercises With the restrictions on therapist input in ICBT, what therapists attend to in messages signal what patients are expected to work on during treatment. A typical message from a patient mid-treatment might include a summary of their latest ERP exercise, comments about what they have found challenging, and a couple of questions about the treatment content. It is very tempting to try to answer the questions and make suggestions for how to deal with the challenges in the response, but that could shift attention away from doing ERP exercises. Rather, we want to encourage the patient to continue doing ERP because that is the key behaviour for them to get better in the long-term. Therapists should therefore strive to balance feedback to aid understanding with actionable advice that patients can put into practice. For example, a lack of clarity in an ERP exercise or choosing the wrong ERP exercise could result in the patient getting stuck and asking questions. A therapist could then address both the uncertainties and promote behaviour change through ERP by suggesting a variation of the ERP exercise or suggesting a new one that is better suited for the situation. This is likely to be a more effective strategy compared to just addressing the questions one by one without linking them to ERP exercises or behaviour change. 5.5 Lack of therapist-guided exposure exercises We do not have the privilege of guiding patients through ERP exercises in ICBT. This means that therapists will have to focus on the essentials when giving corrective feedback to patients. Correcting every little detail before each exercise will in this context probably be counter-productive and might in fact confuse the patient. Instead, our focus is to get patients going with the ERP exercises. Wrinkles can be ironed out along the way. 5.6 Dealing with patients with low engagement The best way to deal with low engagement is to prevent it from happening to begin with. Strategies to prevent low engagement include: Writing frequently (especially in the beginning of treatment in order to keep up momentum) Focusing on encouragement in written messages Promptly calling patients that do not respond to messages Providing support and help to patients that struggle with ERP exercises If a patient becomes less active on the treatment platform, it does not necessarily mean that they have stopped working with the treatment or have given up on the treatment. Some inactive patients are doing a lot of treatment work in their daily life but do not report this spontaneously to their therapist. 5.6.1 Strategies when patients express lack of time to work on the treatment One common reason for low engagement is that the patient struggles to find the time to work on ICBT. We recommend that therapists encourage any small steps the patient takes and that they prioritise ERP exercises away from the computer over reading additional modules. If a patient is completely unable to work on the treatment right now, ask him/her if it possible to delay the start of treatment. The absolute majority of patients responding to OCD-NET and BDD-NET experience this gain within the first 5 weeks after starting treatment. Thus, even if the patient is delayed and start the treatment at week 5, it is still possible to achieve a significant improvement given that the patient works with the treatment intensively. 5.6.2 Strategies when patients express skepticism about ICBT Some patients may be skeptical about ICBT in general or in their ability to complete a remote treatment without face-to-face support from a therapist. We recommend that therapists validate and acknowledge that these concerns are common early in treatment and, importantly, help skeptical patients experience early wins by starting with swift and easy ERP exercises. It is important to stress that OCD-NET and BDD-NET have never been designed as full alternatives to face-to-face CBT but should instead be seen as a complementary approach. Patients who are skeptical about ICBT from the beginning will probably not benefit from this treatment modality. Alternative formats and treatments are probably a more feasible option in these cases.
