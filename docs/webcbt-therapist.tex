\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Welcome to our online therapist resource for \emph{OCD-NET} and
\emph{BDD-NET}. This website contains resources to support therapists in
their work, both technical and clinical aspects of doing internet-based
cognitive behaviour therapy.

We strive to continuously update and improve this material and would
appreciate any feedback. You can reach us at
\href{mailto:ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}{\nolinkurl{ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}}
or talk to us in person at a training session.

\hypertarget{description-of-ocd-net-and-bdd-net}{%
\section{Description of OCD-NET and
BDD-NET}\label{description-of-ocd-net-and-bdd-net}}

OCD-NET and BDD-NET are therapist-guided internet-based cognitive
behaviour (ICBT) therapies for OCD and BDD, respectively. In ICBT,
patients have an identified therapist providing support and feedback
throughout treatment. All contact with the therapist occurs through the
treatment platform as asynchronous text messages (like e-mail or SMS).

\hypertarget{type-of-treatment}{%
\section{Type of treatment}\label{type-of-treatment}}

The intended use of OCD-NET and BDD-NET are within a stepped care model
as an alternative to brief individual CBT, group CBT, serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), or higher-intensity CBT for adults with mild to
moderate symptoms. The treatments are expected to be cost-saving
compared to individual CBT (10 hours or more intensive treatment) but
not compared to group CBT. Crucially, ICBT therapies typically require
less therapist time per patient (10-20 minutes per patient each week)
and could therefore release therapist time compared to individual CBT or
group CBT.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

Both OCD-NET and BDD-NET were initially developed by researchers at
Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. OCD-NET has been evaluated
in six clinical trials to date with results indicating that it is as
effective as regular face-to-face CBT, while requiring less therapist
time per patient and with the advantage of being accessible from any
device connected to the internet
\citep{andersson2011a, andersson2012, andersson2014a, andersson2015a, ruck2018}.
Similarly, BDD-NET has been evaluated in two clinical trials with
comparable results \citep{enander2014, enander2016}. Both treatments
were initially developed in Swedish but have been translated to English
and evaluated in pilot studies in New York (OCD-NET; \citet{patel2017})
and an international pilot study (BDD-NET; Gentile et al., 2018,
\emph{under review}).

\hypertarget{using-the-technology}{%
\chapter{Using the technology}\label{using-the-technology}}

\hypertarget{quick-start}{%
\section{Quick start}\label{quick-start}}

If you want to explore the platform yourself, you can use test therapist
and test patient logins provided to try out the features. We generally
recommend that you use the platform while reading this manual, to test
features as you go along.

\textbf{Therapists access the platform via this URL:
\url{https://webcbt.tst.ki.se/t1}}. This is where therapists enter their
username and password to enter the treatment platform.

\emph{Note that URLs will change once OCD-NET and BDD-NET are used in
clinical work, the current ones are for testing the platform only.}

\hypertarget{platform-use-overview}{%
\section{Platform use overview}\label{platform-use-overview}}

There are five common scenarios during the course of treatment:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Responding to messages
\item
  Reviewing homework
\item
  Opening new treatment modules
\item
  Reviewing questionnaires
\item
  Responding to warning flags
\end{itemize}

These actions can all be accessed in the participant overview, shown
below: \includegraphics{images/participant-overview.png}

A typical day as a therapist includes responding to one or more
messages, reviewing homework and opening up a new module. Once in a
while therapists contact inactive patients or assess a warning flag.

The majority of day to day tasks are accessed via the \emph{Participant
search} menu. The menu is located at the left-hand side of the browser
window. Closing the current participant and clicking \emph{Participant
search} will get you back to the participant overview. To access
individual participants, click the pencil next to their name.

\includegraphics{images/pencil.png}

\hypertarget{navigation}{%
\section{Navigation}\label{navigation}}

The menu bar on the left may expand depending on administrative rights.
Other parts of the menu include administrative settings such as editing
treatment content, editing assessments, editing conditions for when
participant assessments are flagged, and changing settings to the site
itself. These will not be relevant to most therapists and we do not
cover them in detail here. Just remember that you can always go back to
the default view by closing the current participant and navigating to
\emph{Participant search} in the left-hand menu.

\includegraphics{images/therapist-menu.png}

\hypertarget{filtering-the-participant-overview}{%
\section{Filtering the participant
overview}\label{filtering-the-participant-overview}}

To get a quick overview of a long participant list, filter patients that
meet certain criteria, for example belonging to certain groups in
treatment of certain treatments. There is a button called
\emph{Selection} above the participant list. We recommend that
therapists use the ``My participants'' filter to show only patients
assigned to them.

\includegraphics{images/filter-participants.png}

\hypertarget{writing-and-responding-to-messages}{%
\section{Writing and responding to
messages}\label{writing-and-responding-to-messages}}

A new message from a patient will be indicated by this icon
\includegraphics{images/message-icon.png} in the participant overview.
Click the pencil next to the participant's name to access that patient.
Navigate to \emph{Treatments -\textgreater{} participant messages} to
view the message and write a response. See the chapter
\protect\hyperlink{being-an-effective-icbt-therapist}{Being an effective
ICBT therapist} for guidelines on how to write messages.

\includegraphics{images/therapist-messages.png}

\hypertarget{homework-review}{%
\section{Homework review}\label{homework-review}}

A completed homework assignment is shown in the \textbf{Homework} column
in the participant overview. Click the pencil next to the participant
and navigate to \emph{Treatments -\textgreater{} Treatment access} to
review the homework and mark it as completed.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/homework-complete.png}
\caption{Completed homework assignments will show up for review in the
treatment overview, click the checkmark or red button to mark it as
completed or send back to the participant.}
\end{figure}

Please note that patients are not notified if you mark the homework as
incomplete. Write a message to explain what additional information you
need from the patient when they send it in again.

Internet-based CBT relies heavily on self-directed activities and
homework review is a good time to check whether the patient has grasped
important concepts and are able to apply them to their own situation.

\hypertarget{treatment-modules}{%
\section{Treatment modules}\label{treatment-modules}}

When a patient has read a module and completed the corresponding
homework assignment(s), they are ready for the next module. To grant
access to a new module, navigate to \emph{Treatments -\textgreater{}
Treatment access} and check the box next to the next module. A date will
appear next to the module indicating when the module was activated.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/module-access.png}
\caption{Check the box to the left to open a new module}
\end{figure}

The number of modules and weeks in treatment varies between treatment
protocols but a rough guideline is that patients should progress through
one module per week. Some treatment techniques, like exposure with
response prevention, are spread out across several modules to emphasise
their importance and give participants sufficient time to get started on
the technique.

\hypertarget{questionnaires}{%
\section{Questionnaires}\label{questionnaires}}

Before, during, and after treatment, patients are asked to fill out
questionnaires. When new questionnaires are activated they appear as the
patient logs onto the platform. Therapists can review and change which
questionnaires should appear at which day in \emph{Assessments} but we
recommend that therapists stick to the standard schedule whenever
possible. Questionnaires for each patient are listed in this view, click
the paper icon to view responses.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/assessments-list.png}
\caption{Click the paper icon to view responses}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{warning-flags}{%
\section{Warning flags}\label{warning-flags}}

The ICBT platform will display a \emph{warning flag} next to a patient's
name for certain events. The most common flags are due to non-response
to questionnaires. These serve as prompts to therapists to take further
action, for example reaching out by phone to a patient or sending them
another text message reminder.

Once a warning flag has been noticed and dealt with, indicate the action
taken in the \emph{temporary flag text} box in the \emph{Participant
stats} tab (shown below).
\includegraphics{images/temporary-flag-text.png}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Patient has not responded to measurement in time:
  \includegraphics{images/measurement-delay-flag.png}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{suicidality-warning-flags}{%
\subsection{Suicidality warning flags}\label{suicidality-warning-flags}}

The most important type of warning flag is due to heightened
suicidality. The platform is configured to display this flag if a
patient responds 2 or 3 on the suicidality question in PHQ-9.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Warning flag to indicate suicidal ideation:
  \includegraphics{images/suicidality-warning.png}
\end{itemize}

Therapists should refer to local clinical guidelines when performing
suicidality assessments and taking action. We recommend that therapists
ask for guidance of their supervisors if there are any uncertainties.

Once the level of suicidality is deemed to be low enough to not require
further attention, therapists can remove the warning flag under the
\emph{Flags} tab for the participant. Flags are listed under the Flags
tab, click on the pencil to edit a flag.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/flags-tab.png}
\caption{Click on the pencil to edit a flag.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/remove-flag.png}
\caption{Once you have managed a flag, you can make a note that lists
actions taken, and remove the flag.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{supervision}{%
\section{Supervision}\label{supervision}}

Supervision through the platform makes it easy to connect feedback from
the supervisor to specific therapist messages and actions. The
supervision page is found at \emph{Treatment -\textgreater{} Supervision
messages} for each participant. It will look different for the therapist
that is supervised and the supervisor.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/supervision-therapist.png}
\caption{Therapists have a simple interface to write and receive
messages from their supervisor}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/supervisor-view.png}
\caption{Messages between therapist and supervisor to the left,
participant messages to the right for reference}
\end{figure}

The notes are only visible to the supervisor, so that he/she can write
comments about the supervision for future reference. If you are a
supervisor, new messages to review are indicated by an icon for
messages. \includegraphics{images/supervision-message.png}

\hypertarget{assign-new-therapist}{%
\section{Assign new therapist}\label{assign-new-therapist}}

The most typical scenario is that each patient is treated by one
therapist throughout treatment, but it is not uncommon for a second
therapist to act as backup if the primary therapist is not available.

To assign another therapist or change therapist, navigate to the patient
in question and click the \emph{Participant stats} tab. At the bottom of
that page, there is a list of therapists and those assigned to the
patient will have a checkmark next to them. Simply un-check whoever is
to be removed and check whoever is to be assigned the patient.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/assign-therapist.png}
\caption{The numbers next to therapists indicate how many patients they
are assigned to}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{create-new-patient-login}{%
\section{Create new patient login}\label{create-new-patient-login}}

To create a new patient login on the platform, go to the participant
overview by selecting \emph{Participant search} in the left-hand menu.
Select \emph{Create new participant} at the bottom of the participant
list. Therapists can use the ``change password'' button to generate
secure passwords for patients.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/new-participant.png}
\caption{Therapists can generate secure passwords for patients using the
``change password'' button}
\end{figure}

Fields not needed are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Temporary flag text: Usually not needed at creation but might come in
  handy later for communicating between therapists
\item
  Temporary notes: Usually not needed but can be used to store
  information
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ocd-net-and-bdd-net-for-patients}{%
\section{OCD-NET and BDD-NET for
patients}\label{ocd-net-and-bdd-net-for-patients}}

We encourage therapists using OCD-NET and BDD-NET to login with one of
the test patient accounts to see what the platform looks like for
patients. See below for a quick overview of the registration process.

\hypertarget{access}{%
\subsection{Access}\label{access}}

Patients access the platform from the
\href{https://t1.webcbt.tst.ki.se/}{Patient-URL}, which is different
from the therapist URL.

\begin{figure}

\hypertarget{ocd-net-therapist-manual}{%
\chapter{OCD-NET therapist manual}\label{ocd-net-therapist-manual}}

\hypertarget{what-is-ocd-net}{%
\section{What is OCD-NET?}\label{what-is-ocd-net}}

The treatment in OCD-NET is based on established treatment protocols for
OCD \citep{foa2012}, and focuses on exposure with response prevention
(ERP). This means patients do most of the active treatment work away
from their computer or mobile device, for example when they are
performing exposure and response prevention exercises.

\hypertarget{who-is-suitable-for-ocd-net}{%
\section{Who is suitable for
OCD-NET}\label{who-is-suitable-for-ocd-net}}

OCD-NET has been developed to treat adult patients with OCD. In previous
trials evaluating OCD-NET, participants have had comorbid conditions
such as depression and anxiety. Patients may also take antidepressant
medication during the course of treatment. We recommend that patients do
not change the dose during the course of treatment. OCD-NET may also be
delivered to patients with any level of OCD symptom severity. OCD-NET is
text-based and requires sufficient reading skills and understanding of
English. The intended use of OCD-NET is within a stepped-care model
where patients are offered low-intensity treatments as a first step,
\href{https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG31/chapter/1-Guidance\#stepped-care-for-adults-young-people-and-children-with-ocd-or-bdd}{see
the NICE-guidelines}.

\hypertarget{who-is-not-suitable-for-ocd-net}{%
\section{Who is not suitable for
OCD-NET}\label{who-is-not-suitable-for-ocd-net}}

We recommend that the patient is assessed and managed according to local
clinical guidelines if there are indications that OCD-NET may not be a
suitable treatment option. In some cases, treatment can be delayed if an
issue is expected to be resolved in a timely manner, for example if a
patient will have sufficient time to work on the treatment in a few
weeks time. Indications that an individual is not suitable for OCD-NET
include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Moderate to high suicidal ideations where written contact with a
  therapist 1-3 times per week is not enough to safely monitor and
  address risk.\\
\item
  Expresses low motivation, has attention deficits, or marked
  lethargy.\\
\item
  Does not have sufficient time (about 45min/day) to work on
  treatment.\\
\item
  Psychosis, bipolar disorder, untreated substance use disorder, or
  other severe clinical condition that might interfere with treatment.\\
\item
  Severe depression (e.g., MADRS ≥35).\\
\item
  Another ongoing psychological treatment.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{presenting-ocd-net-as-an-option-to-the-patient}{%
\section{Presenting OCD-NET as an option to the
patient}\label{presenting-ocd-net-as-an-option-to-the-patient}}

It is important to stress that previous trials of OCD-NET have been
conducted on patients that have actively requested internet-based
treatment when giving this option. Thus, forcing someone to undertake a
treatment they do not agree with is unhelpful at the very least and can
also be harmful.

With that in mind, we believe there are two particularly strong
arguments for the use of OCD-NET rather than face-to-face therapy:
patients can access the treatment content and therapist therapist
support whenever they want to, and treatment can start right away rather
than after a waiting time.

We have also found that many patients like to contribute to research and
the development of new treatments. For example, most patients will see
the benefit of evaluating remote treatment options.

Other suggestions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Write your first message on the first day of treatment to welcome the
  patient and notify them of ways to contact you with questions
\item
  Provide encouragement throughout treatment to motivate the patient and
  establish a therapeutic working alliance
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{modules-in-ocd-net}{%
\section{Modules in OCD-NET}\label{modules-in-ocd-net}}

There are 10 modules in OCD-NET, which patients are expected to complete
in 12 weeks. Each module consists of texts and uses well established
evidence based interventions for OCD, with exposure and response
prevention (ERP) being the core intervention. To progress to the next
module participants have to complete homework assignments (such as
reading text material, answering a quiz at the end of each module,
completing worksheets, or report about ERP exercises) which are viewed
by their therapist. A patient is ready for the next module once they
have demonstrated the key knowledge and skills through homework,
worksheets and/or messages to the therapist.

\end{longtable}

We view modules 1, 2, 4, and 5 as the core modules in OCD-NET. Modules 1
and 2 consist of two essential features: the patient needs to report at
least some intrusions/compulsions in the OCD diary, and the patient
needs to understand the CBT model of OCD. These two features are the
building blocks for the subsequent ERP exercises in module 4 and 5. We
usually recommend patients to do modules 1-5 in a relatively quick pace
in order to get to the active treatment as soon as possible. It is not
crucial to have a detailed plan for each ERP exercise before starting;
you should encourage patients to get started and fine-tune ERP exercises
as they go along.

You can consider modules 3 and 6 as optional for the patient. We advise
all our patients to read the text in module 3 (thinking mistakes), but
if the patient does not feel that this cognitive intervention is
relevant for them, we proceed directly to module 4 (ERP). Module 6
(imaginal exposure) may be beneficial for some patients but our
experience is that many patients skip this intervention. Although the
text is written from a habituation lens, we often tell our patients that
imaginal exposure may be a tool to learn that having a thought or image
is not the same as acting that way, and to tolerate uncertainty.

The number of completed modules is not an essential predictor of
treatment outcomes in OCD-NET. We have two goals only: get the patient
to module 5 and get the patient to do a lot of ERP exercises. Thus it is
not essential that the patient progress through all modules as long as
he/she does ERP and reports this frequently to the therapist. Patients
will gain access to all modules at the end of treatment, and will be
able to log onto the platform for one year after completing the OCD-NET
treatment. Thus, the role of the therapist is to encourage the patient
to do ERP exercises and help them to design and evaluate ERP exercises
effectively.

Modules 6-9 can be opened in any order to fit the needs of each patient.
For example, a patient might not have any use of imaginal exposure but
finds that they have a hard time refraining from habitual compulsions.
In that case, you may open up module 7 (re-exposure) instead of module 6
(imaginal exposure). Other patients may struggle with ERP exercises and
will find module 8 (difficulties during the treatment) useful. Use your
clinical judgement and discuss with your supervisor.

\hypertarget{what-is-bdd-net}{%
\section{What is BDD-NET?}\label{what-is-bdd-net}}

BDD-NET is a therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behaviour
therapy that consists of eight interactive modules and focuses on
exposure with response prevention (ERP). This means that patients do
most of the active treatment work away from their computer or mobile
device, for example when they are performing ERP exercises.

\hypertarget{differences-between-bdd-net-and-other-psychological-treatments-for-bdd}{%
\subsection{Differences between BDD-NET and other psychological
treatments for
BDD}\label{differences-between-bdd-net-and-other-psychological-treatments-for-bdd}}

BDD-NET is based on two existing treatment manuals for body dysmorphic
disorder (BDD) \citep{veale2010, wilhelm2013} and includes cognitive as
well as behavioural techniques. Exposure and response prevention (ERP)
techniques are emphasised in BDD-NET because they provide concrete
exercises for patients to complete. Results from the two clinical trials
of BDD-NET \citep{enander2014, enander2016} suggest that ERP is an
effective strategy in this guided self-help treatment. Within the ERP
exercises, we suggest that therapists maximise inhibitory learning
\citep{craske2014} by focusing on the new insights that patients get
from ERP, rather than habituation.

ERP and other techniques in BDD-NET are most effective in patients with
at least moderate insight into their BDD who are ready to try new
behaviours. For patients with delusional BDD or those that express low
commitment to change, other treatment options should be considered (see
chapter 14 in \citet{veale2010} for a discussion of these issues).

\hypertarget{who-is-suitable-for-bdd-net}{%
\section{Who is suitable for
BDD-NET}\label{who-is-suitable-for-bdd-net}}

BDD-NET is developed to treat adults with BDD. Patients may have
comorbid conditions, for example other anxiety disorders, depression, or
obsessive compulsive disorder. Patients may also take antidepressant
medication during the course of treatment. We recommend that patients do
not change the dose during the course of treatment. BDD-NET may also be
delivered to patients with any level of BDD symptom severity. The
intended use of BDD-NET is within a stepped-care model where patients
are offered low-intensity treatments as a first step,
\href{https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG31/chapter/1-Guidance\#stepped-care-for-adults-young-people-and-children-with-ocd-or-bdd}{see
the NICE-guidelines}. BDD-NET is text-based and requires sufficient
reading skills and understanding of English.

\hypertarget{who-is-not-suitable-for-bdd-net}{%
\section{Who is not suitable for
BDD-NET}\label{who-is-not-suitable-for-bdd-net}}

We recommend that the patient is assessed and managed according to local
clinical guidelines if there are indications that BDD-NET may not be a
suitable treatment option. In some cases, treatment can be delayed if an
issue is expected to be resolved in a timely manner, for example if a
patient will have sufficient time to work on the treatment in a few
weeks time. Indications that an individual is not suitable for BDD-NET
include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Moderate to high suicidal ideations where written contact with a
  therapist 1-3 times per week is not enough to safely monitor and
  address risk.\\
\item
  Expresses low motivation, has attention deficits, or marked
  lethargy.\\
\item
  Does not have sufficient time (about 45min/day) to work on
  treatment.\\
\item
  Psychosis, bipolar disorder, untreated substance use disorder, or
  other severe clinical condition that might interfere with treatment.\\
\item
  Severe depression (e.g., MADRS ≥35).\\
\item
  Another ongoing psychological treatment.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{presenting-bdd-net-as-an-option-to-the-patient}{%
\section{Presenting BDD-NET as an option to the
patient}\label{presenting-bdd-net-as-an-option-to-the-patient}}

It is important to stress that previous trials of BDD-NET have been
conducted on patients that have actively requested internet-based
treatment when giving this option. Thus, forcing someone to undertake a
treatment they do not agree with is unhelpful at the very least and can
also be harmful. Below are aspects that therapists might want to
consider before patients start BDD-NET.

\hypertarget{assessing-insight}{%
\subsection{Assessing insight}\label{assessing-insight}}

Participating in internet-based treatments such as BDD-NET is voluntary,
and therapists need to make sure that patients are willing to challenge
their BDD in treatment. Lack of insight is common in BDD and BDD-NET is
designed to work for patients that express varying degrees of insight.
It is our experience that patients need to at least be willing to try
out alternative behaviours during the course of treatment, even if they
might still be convinced that their appearance concerns are justified at
the start of treatment.

\hypertarget{managing-expectations}{%
\subsection{Managing expectations}\label{managing-expectations}}

Some patients may have expectations to be completely free from anxiety
after BDD-NET, and that all that is required of them is to read and
understand what is written in the treatment modules. Such expectations
are discussed in module 4 (goal setting) but therapists are advised to
assess whether patients are willing to challenge their BDD through
exposure with response prevention and try out alternative behaviours
before starting BDD-NET. If someone completely refuses to try new
behaviours they are unlikely to actively participate in BDD-NET and
benefit from the treatment.

\hypertarget{a-good-start-in-bdd-net}{%
\subsection{A good start in BDD-NET}\label{a-good-start-in-bdd-net}}

Many patients with BDD find BDD-NET an interesting treatment option,
particularly those who avoid many activities due to their appearance
concerns. The strongest arguments in favour of ICBT treatments like
BDD-NET, from a patient perspective, is that the treatment content and
the therapist are accessible throughout the week, and that the treatment
starts promptly after evaluation rather than after a time in waiting
list.

To give patients a positive first impression of the treatment, we
suggest that therapists write their first message on the first day of
treatment to welcome the patient and introduce treatment content.
Provide encouragement throughout treatment to motivate the patient and
establish a therapeutic working alliance. Patients sometimes struggle
with crucial treatment components such as the BDD diary exposure with
response prevention (ERP), and therapists should provide extra support
at those points, if needed.

\hypertarget{modules-in-bdd-net}{%
\section{Modules in BDD-NET}\label{modules-in-bdd-net}}

Below is an overview of the eight treatment modules. We recommend that
therapists look at them from a patient's point of view before starting
the first treatment. A patient is ready for the next module once they
have demonstrated the key knowledge and skills through homework,
worksheets and/or messages to the therapist.

\end{longtable}

The emphasis is on doing exposure with response prevention (ERP), which
we view as the main component of BDD-NET. We suggest that therapists
encourage patients to progress through the first three modules as fast
as possible (preferably in two weeks or less), check that they have
understood the rationale for ERP, and then start doing ERP. Once
patients are doing regular ERP-exercises, therapists can open up modules
6-7 for them to complete while continuing to do daily ERP. Module 8 can
then be opened up with one to two weeks left in treatment.

\hypertarget{closing-remarks-1}{%
\section{Closing remarks}\label{closing-remarks-1}}

The strategies outlined here should be viewed as the first building
blocks in becoming an effective ICBT therapist using BDD-NET. As in
regular clinical practice, we recommend continuous supervision and that
therapists discuss difficult cases with colleagues.

We strive to continuously update and improve this material and would
appreciate any feedback. You can reach us at

or talk to us in person at a training session.

\hypertarget{being-an-effective-icbt-therapist}{%
\chapter{Being an effective ICBT
therapist}\label{being-an-effective-icbt-therapist}}

Being a therapist in internet-based CBT (ICBT) differs in several ways
from regular face-to-face treatment. The first difference is the mode of
communication: asynchronous text messages rather than live face-to-face
talking. The second is that therapists are more closely integrated in
the treatment content, and will rely more heavily on the written
material. Third, there is less therapist oversight during active ERP
exercises. We will discuss these implications, and give examples on
effective messages in different scenarios, below.

\hypertarget{support-messages}{%
\section{Support messages}\label{support-messages}}

Therapists should write to patients on their first day in treatment,
introduce themselves (if they have not been in contact before) and
present the treatment. For example, therapists can give instructions for
how to navigate the platform, how much time the patient should spend on
the first module, and how to contact mental health services in case of
an emergency.

 Click to read an example of the first message sent to a patient

\emph{Welcome to the treatment!}

\emph{My name is Oskar and I will be your therapist during the 12 weeks
that you are in treatment. You can write messages to me whenever you
have questions or want to discuss the treatment content. I check the
platform every day and will respond as quickly as I can.}

\emph{The treatment is structured as modules, and each module contains
homework exercises as well as worksheets. Once you have read a module
and completed the homework, it is sent to me and I will give you
feedback. As you can see, module 1 is already opened and I look forward
to your comments!}

\emph{Again, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.}

\emph{Best, Oskar}

We recommend that therapists check and respond to messages at least once
per day. Patients in the studies on BDD-NET and OCD-NET have all
received responses within 24 hours on weekdays. We believe that the
frequent feedback from a therapist is important to keep patients engaged
in the therapy throughout treatment.

The most common questions that patients pose in ICBT relate to
understanding and applying the treatment material, clarifying the
therapeutic process, and addressing technical challenges
\citep{soucy2019}.

\hypertarget{keep-your-messages-short}{%
\subsection{Keep your messages short}\label{keep-your-messages-short}}

Messages should be concise and to the point but still using a personal
touch. The main aim is to provide encouragement and reinforce key
behaviours in the treatment, such as registrations in the OCD/BDD diary
and performing ERP exercises.

There are some exceptions to this rule. Therapists are advised to write
longer messages when needed: to highlight examples in the diary that are
informative and relate these to the CBT model of OCD/BDD, or to provide
encouragement by linking ERP exercises to a patient's long-term goals
and values.

\hypertarget{write-often}{%
\subsection{Write often}\label{write-often}}

Frequent communication is particularly useful at the start of treatment
and when patients are in the startup phase of ERP. In many ways, ICBT
may be an even more intensive treatment than traditional face-to-face
CBT for patients. Our standard procedure is to contact patients at least
twice weekly, but more often when needed. For example, therapists may
confirm an exposure exercise in the morning and check in during the
afternoon for a follow-up.

There are exceptions to the rule of frequent messages: some patients
will prefer to do ERP exercises on their own and will not have many
questions. This is perfectly fine; some patients benefit greatly from
the ICBT treatment without the therapist support.

\hypertarget{what-to-include-in-support-messages}{%
\subsection{What to include in support
messages}\label{what-to-include-in-support-messages}}

We recommend that therapists begin by summarising the content in the
patient's message and validate concerns and/or struggles they may have
mentioned. Therapists should then address and provide feedback on
specific treatment activities (completing content on the platform or
practicing skills from treatment in their daily life), with an emphasis
on positive reinforcement and encouragement. An effective ending
typically includes a suggestion of next steps, encouragement to continue
with planned exercises, a question, or a call to action.

\section{Therapists and the rest of the content in
ICBT}\label{therapists-and-the-rest-of-the-content-in-icbt}}

As previously mentioned, ICBT is in many ways a high intensity
treatment. Patients not only respond to messages but also read module
texts, answer homework questions and questionnaires, and fill in
worksheets. The treatment becomes particularly intensive once patients
start performing daily ERP exercises. Thus, what might feel like a
low-intensity treatment from the therapist perspective is actually be
very intensive for patients.

Therapists should keep in mind that patients do many other things
besides writing and responding to messages. Corrective feedback is
sometimes necessary in order to design, do, and evaluate effective ERP
exercises. We recommend that therapists are generally restrictive about
corrective feedback when it is not clearly needed for ERP, but
therapists should use their clinical judgment in these situations.

\hypertarget{promoting-hands-on-erp-exercises}{%
\section{Promoting hands-on ERP
exercises}\label{promoting-hands-on-erp-exercises}}

With the restrictions on therapist input in ICBT, what therapists attend
to in messages signal what patients are expected to work on during
treatment. A typical message from a patient mid-treatment might include
a summary of their latest ERP exercise, comments about what they have
found challenging, and a couple of questions about the treatment
content. It is very tempting to try to answer the questions and make
suggestions for how to deal with the challenges in the response, but
that could shift attention away from doing ERP exercises. Rather, we
want to encourage the patient to continue doing ERP because that is the
key behaviour for them to get better in the long-term.

Therapists should therefore strive to balance feedback to aid
understanding with actionable advice that patients can put into
practice. For example, a lack of clarity in an ERP exercise or choosing
the wrong ERP exercise could result in the patient getting stuck and
asking questions. A therapist could then address both the uncertainties
and promote behaviour change through ERP by suggesting a variation of
the ERP exercise or suggesting a new one that is better suited for the
situation. This is likely to be a more effective strategy compared to
just addressing the questions one by one without linking them to ERP
exercises or behaviour change.

\hypertarget{lack-of-therapist-guided-exposure-exercises}{%
\subsection{Lack of therapist-guided exposure
exercises}\label{lack-of-therapist-guided-exposure-exercises}}

We do not have the privilege of guiding patients through ERP exercises
in ICBT. This means that therapists will have to focus on the essentials
when giving corrective feedback to patients. Correcting every little
detail before each exercise will in this context probably be
counter-productive and might in fact confuse the patient. Instead, our
focus is to get patients going with the ERP exercises. Wrinkles can be
ironed out along the way.

\hypertarget{reinforcing-progress}{%
\section{Reinforcing progress}\label{reinforcing-progress}}

Therapists are advised to provide lots of encouragement when patients
complete core activities in ICBT such as the OCD/BDD diary and
performing ERP exercises. It is helpful to clarify how these activities
contribute to the patient's long-term goals, to repeat main takeaways
from the modules, and to communicate in a personal tone in order to
avoid rigid responses. For example, we often give personal examples of
intrusive thoughts (preferably bizarre ones) in order to normalise that
having unwanted thoughts is not dangerous.

 Click to read an example of a therapist response that reinforces
progress in module 3

\emph{Hi! It's great to see that you work through the material so
quickly and are eager to get started with exercises!}

\emph{You have done a thorough job on this module about interpretations.
It's clear to me that you have embraced the CBT-perspective on thoughts:
it is not the thoughts themselves but how we} interpret \emph{those
thoughts that matters. The problems occur when we respond with
compulsions and other behaviours in response to the intrusive thoughts,
which reinforces the thoughts.}

\emph{In this treatment, we will not try to change the thoughts
themselves, for example by trying to disprove them. Obsessive thoughts
resist logic and will not disappear just by arguing with yourself.
Rather, the goal is for you to gain new experiences by responding
differently to the obsessive thoughts.}

\emph{Great work on module 3, I have granted access to module 4. Good
luck and please reach out if you have any questions!}

 Click to read an example of a therapist encouraging a patient to accept
their obsessive thoughts

\emph{Hi X! Trying to avoid or fight your obsessional thoughts usually
backfires. These strategies intensify the obsessions and keep you
convinced that these thoughts are more harmful, dangerous, and important
than they really are. You become stuck in a vicious cycle.}

\emph{My suggestion is that you try to accept your obsessive thoughts.
Strive to accept the thought ``what if I flirted with that person?'' and
accept the possibility that you might have flirted. Don't try to debate
or argue with your obsessive thoughts. By accepting the thought, you
might conclude that ``yes, I might have flirted with several people, I
have to accept that possibility.''}

\emph{This is not an easy thing to do, and our automatic response is
usually to argue with our thoughts. But if you constantly try to argue
or debate with your obsessive thoughts--or in any other way try to make
them go away--they will find a way back sooner or later. Try to let your
obsessive thoughts exist along every other thought and accept that they
occur from time to time. What do you think?}

\hypertarget{dealing-with-patients-who-struggle-in-treatment}{%
\section{Dealing with patients who struggle in
treatment}\label{dealing-with-patients-who-struggle-in-treatment}}

This list of struggles in ICBT is based on our clinical experience of
developing and working with ICBT for OCD and BDD. We will update the
list when we become aware of other common struggles, so please discuss
difficult cases with your colleagues and in supervision. If you want to
make us aware of a common struggle not listed below, send an email to
\href{mailto:ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}{\nolinkurl{ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}}.

\hypertarget{patients-who-ask-many-questions}{%
\subsection{Patients who ask many
questions}\label{patients-who-ask-many-questions}}

Asking questions to receive reassurance is a common strategy for anxiety
reduction in both BDD and OCD. Therapists should therefore expect more
frequent questions from patients when anxiety levels are likely to be
high: in the beginning of treatment (when they learn more about their
OCD/BDD), and when they are about to start ERP exercises. For example,
it is common for patients to ask whether their OCD/BDD beliefs are
realistic or not, and whether a particular ERP exercise is safe to do.
When this is the case, we recommend that therapists validate the anxiety
patients feel when they challenge their OCD/BDD, but that they refrain
from providing reassurance.

 TODO We could use another example here

\emph{There will be a great example inside here.}

 Click to read an example of a therapist writing about his own bizarre
thoughts

\emph{Hi X! It's impossible to} not \emph{think certain thoughts. You
will always have intrusive sexual thoughts about people close to you.
It's part of being human and I want to remind you to accept that you
have those thoughts from time to time. As soon as you try to argue with
your thoughts or try to analyse them you will be trapped and the
thoughts will be disturbing.}

\emph{Every morning when I change my daughter's diapers, I get an
intrusive thought that I will sexually abuse her. I can't avoid thinking
these thoughts, and I know that if I start to argue with them or try to
make them go away, they will return and become more disturbing. So
instead I accept them and let them exist among my other, more neutral or
positive, thoughts. This is what I want you to try from now on!}

\emph{You have done a great job on the exposures these past days and I
think that the content in module 9 will be helpful for you.}

Other times, there is genuine confusion about the point of a particular
ERP exercise or the content in a module (most common in the modules
about interpretations). When this is the case, make sure that the
patient has learned key skills and takeaways needed for ERP:
understanding the CBT model and the role of safety
behaviours/compulsions in maintaining the disorder, the rationale for
ERP, having specific and measurable goals, and having a plan for ERP
exercises. Once these foundations are in place, therapists should
encourage patients to get started with ERP and adapt exercises as they
go along.

 TODO We could use one example on confusion about interpretations here

\emph{This box will contain the great example.}

 Click to view an example of a therapist explaining the rationale for
imaginal exposure

\emph{Imaginal exposures are a bit special, the point is not for you to}
not \emph{have an emotional reaction to the thoughts. These aggressive
thoughts are unpleasant for anyone, and it is likely that you will
always experience the thought as repugnant. Rather, the point is for you
to practice to let the thought exist without acting on it. By working on
imaginal exposures, you accept that you will have unpleasant thoughts
from time to time and that you don't need to act on them. The point,
then, is that the thought is unpleasant but you can let it exist anyway.
We are not able to control our thoughts and trying to do so usually
backfires. Imaginal exposure presents another way to relate to your
unpleasant thoughts.}

\hypertarget{patients-who-struggle-with-erp-exercises}{%
\subsection{Patients who struggle with ERP
exercises}\label{patients-who-struggle-with-erp-exercises}}

Behaviour change is difficult, and when patients start to challenge
their OCD/BDD with ERP they are likely to experience the exercises as
difficult at some point. In fact, a patient that never has any
difficulties in ERP is likely not doing exercises that are challenging
enough!

There are entire modules dedicated to common difficulties during
treatment, and therapists can refer to the text in those modules for
suggestions on how to respond when patients experience difficulties.
Therapists should write the responses in their own words rather than
copying text from the module.

 Click to read an example of a therapist response when a patient has
expressed worry about doing the right ERP exercises

\emph{Hi, excellent work so far! Having thoughts about not doing the
right ERP exercises is something that most patients experience at one
point or another. This is to be expected and something that your brain
does when you perform ERP. You can view them as one type of obsessive
thoughts that we deal with in the same way we deal with all obsessive
thoughts: we let them exist and leave them alone.}

\emph{(Gives a few suggestions of ERP exercises--previously listed in
the exposure hierarchy--to be performed the same day.) Perhaps you could
do one of these exercises today? I look forward to hearing about how it
went!}

\hypertarget{low-engagement}{%
\subsection{Low engagement}\label{low-engagement}}

The best way to deal with low engagement is to prevent it from happening
to begin with. Strategies to prevent low engagement include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Writing frequently (especially in the beginning of treatment in order
  to keep up momentum)
\item
  Focusing on encouragement in written messages
\item
  Promptly calling patients that do not respond to messages
\item
  Providing support and help to patients that struggle with ERP
  exercises
\end{enumerate}

If a patient becomes less active on the treatment platform, it does not
necessarily mean that they have stopped working with the treatment or
have given up on the treatment. Some inactive patients are doing a lot
of treatment work in their daily life but do not report this
spontaneously to their therapist.

\hypertarget{lack-of-time-to-work-on-the-treatment}{%
\subsection{Lack of time to work on the
treatment}\label{lack-of-time-to-work-on-the-treatment}}

One common reason for low engagement is that the patient struggles to
find the time to work on ICBT. We recommend that therapists encourage
any small steps the patient takes and that they prioritise ERP exercises
away from the computer over reading additional modules.

If a patient is completely unable to work on the treatment right now,
ask him/her if it possible to delay the start of treatment. The absolute
majority of patients responding to OCD-NET and BDD-NET experience this
gain within the first 5 weeks after starting treatment. Thus, even if
the patient is delayed and start the treatment at week 5, it is still
possible to achieve a significant improvement given that the patient
works with the treatment intensively.

 TODO This should also be exempified

\emph{Example example}

\hypertarget{skepticism-about-icbt}{%
\subsection{Skepticism about ICBT}\label{skepticism-about-icbt}}

Some patients may be skeptical about ICBT in general or in their ability
to complete a remote treatment without face-to-face support from a
therapist. We recommend that therapists validate and acknowledge that
these concerns are common early in treatment and, importantly, help
skeptical patients experience \emph{early wins} by starting with swift
and easy ERP exercises.

 Click to read an example response to a patient that is ambivalent
towards CBT

\emph{Hi X! I notice that you are ambivalent about doing this treatment
and that you have some doubts whether CBT will really help you. First of
all, I really appreciate that you are honest about this!}

\emph{It is completely normal to be ambivalent early in the treatment.
Most people feel that their rituals are excessive and out of control,
but still worry that a disaster might happen if they stop doing them.
Others might be afraid that they will be asked to do absurd things in
treatment that is completely against their idea of normal behaviours.
Another reason for being ambivalent is not feeling like you have enough
time to devote to treatment. If one or more of these apply to you, know
that others who have ended up benefitting greatly from the treatment
have also been ambivalent.}

\emph{Overcoming OCD/BDD is challenging, and you will have to face your
fears and reduce (or stop) your rituals at some point. But it's worth
it. The anxiety and fear provoked by the treatment are temporary side
effects, and they don't have any long-lasting harmful consequences. If
you engage with this treatment, you have a good chance of reclaiming
control and freedom in your life.}

\emph{My role as your therapist is to support you throughout treatment,
and I want to stress that} you \emph{are the one in the driver's seat.
You decide which goals are important to reach, and you will do the work
to get better. I therefore ask that you give this treatment a chance and
do your best to follow the instructions, because then you will be giving
yourself the best possible chances of getting over your OCD/BDD.}

It is important to stress that OCD-NET and BDD-NET have never been
designed as full alternatives to face-to-face CBT but should instead be
seen as a complementary approach. Patients who are skeptical about ICBT
from the beginning will probably not benefit from this treatment
modality. Alternative formats and treatments are probably a more
feasible option in these cases.

\hypertarget{perceived-external-pressure}{%
\subsection{Perceived external
pressure}\label{perceived-external-pressure}}

Some patients are pressured to come for an assessment, typically by a
close relative or, in the case of BDD, sometimes by a cosmetic surgeon.
Patients that are under external pressure to undergo treatment should
not be selected for ICBT treatments such as OCD-NET or BDD-NET, since
these treatments require self-guided exposure exercises to be effective.

\hypertarget{deterioration-in-symptom-measures}{%
\subsection{Deterioration in symptom
measures}\label{deterioration-in-symptom-measures}}

A deterioration in symptom measures can sometimes occur when patients
start doing ERP exercises and is usually not an issue if symptoms are
reduced in the following weeks.

If symptom levels remain high despite frequent ERP exercises, share this
information with the patient and discuss what might explain this
pattern. We list some common explanations below.

\hypertarget{ending-treatment-prematurely}{%
\section{Ending treatment
prematurely}\label{ending-treatment-prematurely}}

\hypertarget{due-to-inactivity}{%
\subsection{Due to inactivity}\label{due-to-inactivity}}

We recommend that patients who have been inactive for \textbf{20 days}
end treatment. However, the treatment platform will create a flag after
7 days of inactivity to alert therapists. Before ending treatment, there
are several steps that therapists can take to avoid long periods of
inactivity.

\textbf{When the inactivity flag appears:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ensure that SMS reminders are working properly: Do you still have the
  correct number? Are the text messages being sent?\\
\item
  Check previous messages: Has the patient indicated in a previous
  message that they will be away? Do they have a plan for how to work on
  treatment while being away from a computer?\\
\item
  Write a message on the platform where you encourage the patient to log
  onto the platform and report their progress in treatment.\\
\item
  Wait 4 days.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4 days after inactivity flag:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make a telephone call to the patient. If no response, write a text
  message with information about when you will call. Then try at the
  indicated time.\\
\item
  Send a letter to the patient with instructions to log onto the
  platform. Provide information that treatment will end prematurely if
  the patient is inactive for 20 days.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{After 20 days of inactivity:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Check that the assessment dates are correct.\\
\item
  Write one more message to the patient where you inform that the
  treatment has ended and ask that they complete assessments.\\
\item
  Move the patient to ``post-assessment'' group.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{increased-suicidality-or-self-harm}{%
\subsection{Increased suicidality or
self-harm}\label{increased-suicidality-or-self-harm}}

Patients who express ongoing suicidal thoughts or have ongoing self-harm
behaviour should be referred to treatments with more intensive
monitoring and are generally not recommended to start ICBT. However,
some patients who undergo CBT for OCD and BDD express a short-term
increase in suicidal ideation or self-harm behaviour while in treatment.

If this is detected either through patient-therapist messages or in
weekly measurements, we recommend that therapists follow local
guidelines to assess and manage risk. If a patient requires more
intensive monitoring, recurring telephone assessments can be added while
continuing with the treatment. In other cases, treatment will need to be
ended prematurely in order to manage the increase in suicidality.

\hypertarget{other-reasons}{%
\subsection{Other reasons}\label{other-reasons}}

A patient may request that they end treatment early for another reason
than the two outlined above. Our recommendation is that therapists
encourage patients to continue if they express common difficulties
(e.g., struggling with the first ERP exercise or is skeptical of
OCD-NET/BDD-NET prior to trying ERP for the first time). Most of these
difficulties can be resolved within a week or two with increased
therapist support. Seek supervision when necessary.

\textbf{If a patient asks to end treatment early, call them. Go through
the following points in the call:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the reason, are there any misunderstandings about the
  treatment that you can clarify? Are they concerned about not doing
  well enough in the treatment? See if you can motivate the patient to
  at least try a few exposure exercises.\\
\item
  Does the patient feel that the treatment does not address their main
  concerns? See if you can understand what type of help the patient
  wants and assess whether the ongoing treatment is likely to address
  that or not.\\
\item
  Is the patient likely to benefit from the treatment if they perform
  key behaviours (e.g., exposure with response prevention)? If not, it
  is advisable to end treatment early rather than complete the full
  duration.
\end{itemize}

You may come to the conclusion that the treatment is not suitable for
the patient (see a list in the OCD-NET and BDD-NET manuals), or that the
patient is unlikely to benefit from OCD-NET or BDD-NET. Weekly
assessments should then be de-activated on the platform, but keep the
post-assessment as is. If no further action is necessary, inform the
patient that they will be asked to return to the clinic for a
post-assessment after the treatment period is over.

\hypertarget{technical-support}{%
\chapter{Technical support}\label{technical-support}}

This page contains support for common issues that might arise when using
the OCD-NET and BDD-NET treatments.

\hypertarget{technical-support-for-patients}{%
\section{Technical support for
patients}\label{technical-support-for-patients}}

The platform is designed to be user-friendly for patients with varying
technical know-how. They will, however, require technical support from
time to time. If patients report technical issues that you cannot
address yourself, send an email to
\href{mailto:ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}{\nolinkurl{ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}}
and ask for assistance.

\hypertarget{forgotten-username-or-password}{%
\subsection{Forgotten username or
password}\label{forgotten-username-or-password}}

If a patient has forgotten their password, they can request a new one at
the login screen:

\includegraphics{images/patient-login.png}

If they have forgotten their username, simply look at their
\emph{Participant stats} and \textbf{Login} is their username.

If a patient is unable to generate a new password on their own, navigate
to the patient in question and the \emph{Participant stats} tab. Click
the \emph{Change password} button. The site generates a new, secure,
password that can be sent to the patient via SMS.

\hypertarget{the-website-does-not-work}{%
\subsection{The website does not work}\label{the-website-does-not-work}}

This is usually for one of three reasons: wrong information
(URL/username/password), the patient is using an out of date web
browser, or there is an issue with cookies on the site.

\hypertarget{wrong-urlusernamepassword}{%
\subsubsection{Wrong
URL/username/password}\label{wrong-urlusernamepassword}}

Make sure that the patient has correct information for all three. Also
make sure that there are no errors in the username!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  URL is \url{https://webcbt.se/ocdnet} for OCD and
  \url{https://webcbt.se/bddnet} for BDD
\item
  Username is indicated by ``Login'' at \emph{Participant stats}
\item
  Their password is hidden to therapists and can be re-generated by
  patients themselves or by therapists (see above)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{recommended-web-browsers}{%

The treatment is accessible for both desktop web browsers and mobile web
browsers (iOS, Android). The platform works best for either
\textbf{Google Chrome}, \textbf{Firefox}, or \textbf{Safari}. Internet
explorer and Microsoft Edge are not recommended, although newer versions
of those browsers usually work just fine.

\hypertarget{cookies-and-cache}{%
