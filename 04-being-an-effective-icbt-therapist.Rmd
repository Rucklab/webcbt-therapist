# Being an effective ICBT therapist

Being a therapist in internet-based CBT (ICBT) differs in several ways from regular face-to-face treatment. The first difference is the mode of communication: asynchronous text messages rather than live face-to-face talking. The second is that therapists are more closely integrated in the treatment content, and will rely more heavily on the written material. Third, there is less therapist oversight during active ERP exercises. We will discuss these implications below.

## Keep your messages short

Messages should be concise and to the point but still using a personal touch. The main aim is to provide encouragement and reinforce key behaviours in the treatment, such as registrations in the OCD/BDD diary and performing ERP exercises.

There are some exceptions to this rule. Therapists are advised to write longer messages when needed: to highlight examples in the diary that are informative and relate these to the CBT model of OCD/BDD, or to provide encouragement by linking ERP exercises to a patient's long-term goals and values.

## Write often

Frequent communication is particularly useful at the start of treatment and when patients are in the startup phase of ERP. In many ways, ICBT may be an even more intensive treatment than traditional face-to-face CBT for patients. Our standard procedure is to contact patients at least twice weekly, but more often when needed. For example, therapists may confirm an exposure exercise in the morning and check in during the afternoon for a follow-up. 

There are exceptions to the rule of frequent messages: some patients will prefer to do ERP exercises on their own and will not have many questions. This is perfectly fine; some patients benefit greatly from the ICBT treatment without the therapist support.

## Therapists and the rest of the content in ICBT

As previously mentioned, ICBT is in many ways a high intensity treatment. Patients not only respond to messages but also read module texts, answer homework questions and questionnaires, and fill in worksheets. The treatment becomes particularly intensive once patients start performing daily ERP exercises. Thus, what might feel like a low-intensity treatment from the therapist perspective is actually be very intensive for patients.

Therapists should keep in mind that patients do many other things besides writing and responding to messages. Corrective feedback is sometimes necessary in order to design, do, and evaluate effective ERP exercises. We recommend that therapists are generally restrictive about corrective feedback when it is not clearly needed for ERP, but therapists should use their clinical judgment in these situations.

## Promoting hands-on ERP exercises

With the restrictions on therapist input in ICBT, what therapists attend to in messages signal what patients are expected to work on during treatment. A typical message from a patient mid-treatment might include a summary of their latest ERP exercise, comments about what they have found challenging, and a couple of questions about the treatment content. It is very tempting to try to answer the questions and make suggestions for how to deal with the challenges in the response, but that could shift attention away from doing ERP exercises. Rather, we want to encourage the patient to continue doing ERP because that is the key behaviour for them to get better in the long-term.

Therapists should therefore strive to balance feedback to aid understanding with actionable advice that patients can put into practice. For example, a lack of clarity in an ERP exercise or choosing the wrong ERP exercise could result in the patient getting stuck and asking questions. A therapist could then address both the uncertainties and promote behaviour change through ERP by suggesting a variation of the ERP exercise or suggesting a new one that is better suited for the situation. This is likely to be a more effective strategy compared to just addressing the questions one by one without linking them to ERP exercises or behaviour change.

## Lack of therapist-guided exposure exercises

We do not have the privilege of guiding patients through ERP exercises in ICBT. This means that therapists will have to focus on the essentials when giving corrective feedback to patients. Correcting every little detail before each exercise will in this context probably be counter-productive and might in fact confuse the patient. Instead, our focus is to get patients going with the ERP exercises. Wrinkles can be ironed out along the way.

## Dealing with patients with low engagement

The best way to deal with low engagement is to prevent it from happening to begin with. Strategies to prevent low engagement include:

1. Writing frequently (especially in the beginning of treatment in order to keep up momentum)
2. Focusing on encouragement in written messages
3. Promptly calling patients that do not respond to messages
4. Providing support and help to patients that struggle with ERP exercises

If a patient becomes less active on the treatment platform, it does not necessarily mean that they have stopped working with the treatment or have given up on the treatment. Some inactive patients are doing a lot of treatment work in their daily life but do not report this spontaneously to their therapist.

### Strategies when patients express lack of time to work on the treatment

One common reason for low engagement is that the patient struggles to find the time to work on ICBT. We recommend that therapists encourage any small steps the patient takes and that they prioritise ERP exercises away from the computer over reading additional modules.

If a patient is completely unable to work on the treatment right now, ask him/her if it possible to delay the start of treatment. The absolute majority of patients responding to OCD-NET and BDD-NET experience this gain within the first 5 weeks after starting treatment. Thus, even if the patient is delayed and start the treatment at week 5, it is still possible to achieve a significant improvement given that the patient works with the treatment intensively.

### Strategies when patients express skepticism about ICBT

Some patients may be skeptical about ICBT in general or in their ability to complete a remote treatment without face-to-face support from a therapist. We recommend that therapists validate and acknowledge that these concerns are common early in treatment and, importantly, help skeptical patients experience *early wins* by starting with swift and easy ERP exercises.

It is important to stress that OCD-NET and BDD-NET have never been designed as full alternatives to face-to-face CBT but should instead be seen as a complementary approach. Patients who are skeptical about ICBT from the beginning will probably not benefit from this treatment modality. Alternative formats and treatments are probably a more feasible option in these cases.

### Perceived external pressure

Some patients are pressured to come for an assessment, typically by a close relative or, in the case of BDD, sometimes by a cosmetic surgeon. Patients that are under external pressure to undergo treatment should not be selected for ICBT treatments such as OCD-NET or BDD-NET, since these treatments require self-guided exposure exercises to be effective.
