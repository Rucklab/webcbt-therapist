\hypertarget{quick-start}{%
\section{Quick start}\label{quick-start}}

If you want to explore the platform yourself, you can use test therapist
and test patient logins provided to try out the features (separate
document). We generally recommend that you use the platform while
reading this manual, to test features as you go along.

\hypertarget{using-the-platform}{%
\section{Using the platform}\label{using-the-platform}}

There are five common scenarios during the course of treatment:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Responding to messages
\item
  Reviewing homework
\item
  Opening new treatment modules
\item
  Reviewing questionnaires
\item
  Responding to warning flags
\end{itemize}

These actions can all be accessed in the participant overview, shown
below: \includegraphics{images/participant-overview.png}

A typical day as a therapist includes responding to one or more
messages, reviewing homework and opening up a new module. Once in a
while you will write to remind an inactive patient or assess a warning
flag.

\textbf{Quick note: We use Participant and Patient as synonyms here.}

\hypertarget{navigation}{%
\subsection{Navigation}\label{navigation}}

You will be using the platform from the \emph{Participant search} menu
99\% of the time. If you get lost while using the platform, click
\emph{Participant search} to get back to the default view. When you want
to access individual participants, click the pencil next to their name.

\includegraphics{images/pencil.png}

This menu may expand depending on your administrative rights. Other
parts of the menu include administrative settings such as editing
treatment content, editing assessments, changing the way flags appear,
and changing settings to the site itself. These will not be relevant to
most therapists and we do not cover them in detail here. Just remember
that you can always go back to the default view by navigating to
\emph{Participant search} in the left-hand menu.

\includegraphics{images/therapist-menu.png}

\hypertarget{filtering-the-participant-overview}{%
\subsection{Filtering the participant
overview}\label{filtering-the-participant-overview}}

To get a quick overview, you can filter patients that are relevant to
you. If you look at the top of the participant overview, there is a
button called \emph{Selection}. We recommend that therapists use the
``My participants'' filter to show only patients assigned to them.

You can also filter patients by project (for example OCD-NET or
BDD-NET), groups (for example ``In treatment'' or ``post-treatment'').

\includegraphics{images/filter-participants.png}

\hypertarget{writing-and-responding-to-messages}{%
\subsection{Writing and responding to
messages}\label{writing-and-responding-to-messages}}

Written messages are the main form of communication---and often the only
communication---between therapist and patient in internet-based CBT.
Care and attention to messages should be applied accordingly{[}\^{}
Writing effective messages in internet-based CBT---as any form of
writing---is a difficult skill to master that requires practice. General
advice on writing often applies here as well. We have found that
feedback from colleagues is often as useful as standardised guidelines.
Some quick tips though: read your message aloud to spot mistakes and
complicated sentences, be as concise as possible, and save questions or
action points to the end of your message.{]}.

When you log onto the platform, a new message from a patient will be
indicated by this icon turning red
\includegraphics{images/message-icon.png}. Navigate to \emph{Treatments
-\textgreater{} participant messages} to view the message and write your
response.

\includegraphics{images/therapist-messages.png}

\hypertarget{homework-review}{%
\subsection{Homework review}\label{homework-review}}

A completed homework assignment is shown in the \textbf{Homework} column
in the participant overview. Click the pencil next to the participant
and navigate to \emph{Treatments -\textgreater{} Treatment access} to
review the homework and mark it as completed.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/homework-complete.png}
\caption{Completed homework assignments will show up for review in the
treatment overview}
\end{figure}

Internet-based CBT relies heavily on self-directed activities and
homework review is a good time to check whether the patient has grasped
important concepts and are able to apply them to their own situation.

\hypertarget{treatment-modules}{%
\subsection{Treatment modules}\label{treatment-modules}}

When a patient has read a module and completed the corresponding
homework assignment(s), they are ready for the next module. Grant access
to a new module by navigating to \emph{Treatments -\textgreater{}
Treatment access} and checking the box next to the next module. A date
will appear next to the module indicating when the module was activated.
Patients automatically get a text message when you open up a new module.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/module-access.png}
\caption{Check the box to the left to open a new module}
\end{figure}

The number of modules and weeks in treatment varies but a rough
guideline is that patients should progress through one module per week.
Some treatment techniques, like exposure with response prevention in
obsessive compulsive disorder, are spread out across several modules to
emphasise their importance and iron out wrinkles that many patients
experience.

While it is certainly satisfying to see that a patient has fully grasped
a concept in treatment, therapists are advised against requiring perfect
answers. Patients getting stuck on a certain module may feel less
motivated to continue treatment, so choose revisions wisely. Older
modules are always available to review throughout treatment.

\hypertarget{questionnaires}{%
\subsection{Questionnaires}\label{questionnaires}}

Before, during, and after treatment, patients are asked to fill out
questionnaires. When new questionnaires are activated they appear as the
patient logs onto the platform. You can review and change which
questionnaires should appear at which day in \emph{Assessments} but we
recommend that you stick to the standard schedule whenever possible.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/assessments-list.png}
\caption{Questionnaires for each patient are listed in this view}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{warning-flags}{%
\subsection{Warning flags}\label{warning-flags}}

The Web CBT platform will display a \emph{warning flag} next to a
patient's name for certain events. The most common flags are due to
inactivity or non-response to questionnaires. These serve as prompts to
therapists to take further action, for example reaching out by phone to
a patient or sending them another text message reminder.

Once you have noticed a warning flag and started to deal with it, you
may indicate your action in the \emph{temporary flag text} box in the
\emph{Participant stats} tab (shown below). Please note, however that
inactivity flags automatically disappear once then patient uses the
platform again.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/temporary-flag-text.png}
\caption{Temporary flag texts aid communication between therapists when
they manage flags}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{common-warning-flags}{%
\subsubsection{Common warning flags}\label{common-warning-flags}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Patient has not logged in for 7 days:
  \includegraphics{images/login-inactivity-flag.png}
\item
  Patient has not written a message in 7 days:
  \includegraphics{images/message-inactivity-flag.png}
\item
  Patient has not responded to measurement in time:
  \includegraphics{images/measurement-delay-flag.png}
\item
  Patient has no assigned therapist:
  \includegraphics{images/notherapist-flag.png}
\item
  Treatment ends within 1 week:
  \includegraphics{images/oneweek-therapyends-flag.png}
\item
  Treatment has ended: \includegraphics{images/therapy-ended-flag.png}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{suicidality-warning-flags}{%
\subsubsection{Suicidality warning
flags}\label{suicidality-warning-flags}}

The most important type of warning flag is due to heightened
suicidality. We have configured the platform to display this flag if a
patient responds 4 or higher on the suicidality question in MADRS-S.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Warning flag to indicate suicidal ideation:
  \includegraphics{images/suicidality-warning.png}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Local clinical guidelines may overrule the general course of
action outlined here.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Call the patient immediately
\item
  Explain that it is standard procedure to call when a patient indicates
  heightened suicidal ideation
\item
  Follow a hierarchy of questions, such as M.I.N.I. interview, to assess
  level of suicidality
\item
  If the immediate risk is low (i.e.~MADRS-S score of 4), make an
  agreement to check back in with the patient in a few days and give
  them contact information to the nearest 24-hour psychiatric care unit
\item
  If the immediate risk is high (i.e.~MADRS-S score of 5-6), advise the
  patient to seek immediate help at your centre or at a 24-hour
  psychiatric care unit.
\end{enumerate}

Once the level of suicidality is deemed to be low enough to not require
further attention, you may remove the warning flag under the
\emph{Flags} tab for the participant.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/flags-tab.png}
\caption{Flags are listed under the Flags tab, click on the pencil to
edit flag.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/remove-flag.png}
\caption{Once you have managed a flag, you can make a note that lists
actions taken, and remove the flag.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{supervision}{%
\subsection{Supervision}\label{supervision}}

Supervision through the platform makes it easy to connect feedback from
the supervisor to specific therapist messages and actions. The
supervision page is found at \emph{Treatment -\textgreater{} Supervision
messages} for each participant.

\includegraphics{images/supervision.png}

\hypertarget{assign-new-therapist}{%
\subsection{Assign new therapist}\label{assign-new-therapist}}

The most typical scenario is that each patient is treated by one
therapist throughout treatment, but it is not uncommon for a second
therapist to act as backup if the primary therapist is not available.

To assign another therapist or change therapist, navigate to the patient
in question and click the \emph{Participant stats} tab. At the bottom of
that page, you will see a list of therapists and those assigned to the
patient will have a checkmark next to them. Simply un-check whoever is
to be removed and check whoever is to be assigned the patient.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/assign-therapist.png}
\caption{The number 2 next to Oskar Flygare indicates that he is
assigned to 2 patients}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{create-new-patient-login}{%
\subsection{Create new patient login}\label{create-new-patient-login}}

To create a new patient login on the platform, go to the participant
overview by selecting \emph{Participant search} in the left-hand menu.
Select \emph{Create new participant} at the bottom of the participant
list.

\includegraphics{images/new-participant.png}

Fields not needed are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Participant ID: Internal ID for the platform. Usually not needed.
\item
  Password: New patient logins are created without passwords. The first
  time the patient logs onto the platform they will be asked to generate
  a password
\item
  Temporary flag text: Usually not needed at creation but might come in
  handy later for communicating between therapists
\item
  Temporary notes: Usually not needed
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ocd-net-therapist-manual}{%
\chapter{OCD-NET therapist manual}\label{ocd-net-therapist-manual}}

\hypertarget{what-is-ocd-net}{%
\section{What is OCD-NET?}\label{what-is-ocd-net}}

OCD-NET is a therapist-guided internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy
for OCD developed by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm,
Sweden. OCD-NET has been evaluated in six clinical trials to date with
results indicating that it is as effective as regular face-to-face CBT,
while requiring less therapist time per patient and with the advantage
of being accessible from any device connected to the internet
\citep{andersson2011a, andersson2012, andersson2014a, andersson2015a, ruck2018}.

OCD-NET is a therapist-guided treatment, which means that patients have
an identified therapist providing support and feedback throughout
treatment. All contact with the therapist occurs through the treatment
platform as asynchronous text messages (like e-mail or SMS).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5.20833in,height=\textheight]{images/therapist-messages.png}
\caption{Messages from the therapists point of view}
\end{figure}

The treatment in OCD-NET is based on established treatment protocols for
OCD \citep{foa2012}, and focuses on exposure with response prevention
(ERP). This means patients do most of the active treatment work away
from their computer or mobile device, for example when they are
performing exposure and response prevention exercises.

\hypertarget{who-is-suitable-for-ocd-net}{%
\subsection{Who is suitable for
OCD-NET}\label{who-is-suitable-for-ocd-net}}

OCD-NET has been developed to treat adult patients with OCD. In previous
trials evaluating OCD-NET, participants have had comorbid conditions
such as depression and anxiety, while autism spectrum disorder,
psychotic symptoms and substance use disorder have been exclusion
criteria.

The intended use of OCD-NET is within a stepped-care model where
patients are offered low-intensity treatments as a first step,
\href{https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG31/chapter/1-Guidance\#stepped-care-for-adults-young-people-and-children-with-ocd-or-bdd}{see
the NICE-guidelines}. We therefore recommend that OCD-NET is primarily
used for patients with mild to moderate symptom severity without
comorbid autism spectrum disorder, psychotic symptoms, or substance use
disorder.

\hypertarget{presenting-ocd-net-as-an-option-to-the-patient}{%
\subsection{Presenting OCD-NET as an option to the
patient}\label{presenting-ocd-net-as-an-option-to-the-patient}}

It is important to stress that previous trials of OCD-NET have been
conducted on patients that have actively requested internet-based
treatment when giving this option. Thus, forcing someone to undertake a
treatment they do not agree with is unhelpful at the very least and can
also be harmful.

With that in mind, we believe there are two particularly strong
arguments for the use of OCD-NET rather than face-to-face therapy:
patients can access the treatment content and therapist therapist
support whenever they want to, and treatment can start right away rather
than after a waiting time.

We have also found that many patients like to contribute to research and
the development of new treatments. For example, most patients will see
the benefit of evaluating remote treatment options.

Other suggestions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Write your first message on the first day of treatment to welcome the
  patient and notify them of ways to contact you with questions
\item
  Provide encouragement throughout treatment to motivate the patient and
  establish a therapeutic working alliance
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{modules-in-ocd-net}{%
\subsection{Modules in OCD-NET}\label{modules-in-ocd-net}}

There are 10 modules in OCD-NET, which patients are expected to complete
in 12 weeks. Each module consists of texts and uses well established
evidence based interventions for OCD, with exposure and response
prevention (ERP) being the core intervention. To progress to the next
module participants have to complete homework assignments (such as
reading text material, answering a quiz at the end of each module,
completing worksheets, or report about ERP exercises) which are viewed
by their therapist.

\end{longtable}

We view modules 1, 2, 4, and 5 as the core modules in OCD-NET. Modules 1
and 2 consist of two essential features: the patient needs to report at
least some intrusions/compulsions in the OCD diary, and the patient
needs to understand the CBT model of OCD. These two features are the
building blocks for the subsequent ERP exercises in module 4 and 5. We
usually recommend patients to do modules 1-5 in a relatively quick pace
in order to get to the active treatment as soon as possible. It is not
crucial to have a detailed plan for each ERP exercise before starting;
you should encourage patients to get started and fine-tune ERP exercises
as they go along.

You can consider modules 3 and 6 as optional for the patient. We advise
all our patients to read the text in module 3 (thinking mistakes), but
if the patient does not feel that this cognitive intervention is
relevant for them, we proceed directly to module 4 (ERP). Module 6
(imaginal exposure) may be beneficial for some patients but our
experience is that many patients skip this intervention. Although the
text is written from a habituation lens, we often tell our patients that
imaginal exposure may be a tool to learn that having a thought or image
is not the same as acting that way, and to tolerate uncertainty.

The number of completed modules is not an essential predictor of
treatment outcomes in OCD-NET. We have two goals only: get the patient
to module 5 and get the patient to do a lot of ERP exercises. Thus it is
not essential that the patient progress through all modules as long as
he/she does ERP and reports this frequently to the therapist. Patients
will gain access to all modules at the end of treatment, and will be
able to log onto the platform for one year after completing the OCD-NET
treatment. Thus, the role of the therapist is to encourage the patient
to do ERP exercises and help them to design and evaluate ERP exercises
effectively.

Modules 6-9 can be opened in any order to fit the needs of each patient.
For example, a patient might not have any use of imaginal exposure but
finds that they have a hard time refraining from habitual compulsions.
In that case, you may open up module 7 (re-exposure) instead of module 6
(imaginal exposure). Other patients may struggle with ERP exercises and
will find module 8 (difficulties during the treatment) useful. Use your
clinical intuition.

We hope that you have found this therapist guide useful. Our goal has
been to present a few ideas about how to deliver OCD-NET effectively.
These are just the first building blocks and you will likely find that
adaptations are needed to your particular patients and your own style as
a therapist.

We strive to continuously update and improve this material and would

\hypertarget{what-is-bdd-net}{%
\section{What is BDD-NET?}\label{what-is-bdd-net}}

\emph{Detailed review of the content of the product. What therapeutic
interventions are included and how are they implemented?}

BDD-NET is a therapist-guided, internet-delivered cognitive behaviour
therapy (ICBT) for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) developed by
researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. BDD-NET has
been evaluated in three clinical trials to date with results indicating
that it is as effective as regular face-to-face CBT, while requiring
less therapist time per patients and with the advantage of being
accessible from any device connected to the internet
\citep{enander2014, enander2016}.

BDD-NET consists of eight interactive modules and is based on a
treatment protocol by Sabine Wilhelm and colleagues \citep{wilhelm2013}
that focuses on exposure with response prevention. This means that
patients do most of the active treatment work away from their computer
or mobile device, for example when they are performing exposure and
response prevention exercises.

In BDD-NET, therapists and patients communicate through asynchronous
text messages (like e-mail or SMS) throughout treatment. The primary
role of therapists is to provide support and feedback related to the
treatment exercises.

BDD-NET}\label{who-is-suitable-for-bdd-net}}

\emph{The clinical condition that the digital product has been developed
for and the recommended range of symptom severities for patients using
the digital product.}

BDD-NET is developed to treat adults with body dysmorphic disorder
(BDD). Patients may have comorbid conditions, for example other anxiety
disorders, depression, or OCD. Patients may also take antidepressant
medication during the course of treatment. We recommend that patients do
not change the dose during the course of treatment. BDD-NET may also be
delivered to patients with any level of BDD symptom severity.

Contraindications include having a personality disorder that might
interfere with treatment (such as borderline personality disorder),
psychotic symptoms, an ongoing substance abuse, or acute suicidal
ideation. BDD-NET is text-based and so requires sufficient reading
skills and understanding of English. We recommend that the patient is
referred to face-to-face treatments if contraindications are discovered.

\emph{How to present the digital product to patients in a way that
generates enthusiasm and ensures that the patient promptly starts using
the product. Managing patients' expectations of BDD-NET therapy}

\hypertarget{assessing-insight}{%
\subsection{Assessing insight}\label{assessing-insight}}

Participating in internet-based treatments such as BDD-NET is voluntary,
and therapists need to make sure that patients are willing to challenge
their BDD in treatment. Lack of insight is common in BDD and BDD-NET is
designed to work for patients that express varying degrees of insight.
It is our experience that patients need to at least be willing to try
out alternative behaviours during the course of treatment, even if they
might still be convinced that their appearance concerns are justified at
the start of treatment.

\hypertarget{managing-expectations}{%
\subsection{Managing expectations}\label{managing-expectations}}

Some patients may have expectations to be completely free from anxiety
after BDD-NET, and that all that is required of them is to read and
understand what is written in the treatment modules. Such expectations
are discussed in module 4 (goal setting) but therapists are advised to
assess whether patients are willing to challenge their BDD through
exposure with response prevention and try out alternative behaviours
before starting BDD-NET. If someone completely refuses to try new
behaviours they are unlikely to participate in BDD-NET fully and benefit
from the treatment.

\hypertarget{a-good-start-in-bdd-net}{%
\subsection{A good start in BDD-NET}\label{a-good-start-in-bdd-net}}

Many patients with BDD find BDD-NET an interesting treatment option,
particularly those who avoid many activities due to their appearance
concerns. The strongest arguments in favour of ICBT treatments like
BDD-NET, from a patient perspective, is that the treatment content and
the therapist are accessible throughout the week, and that the treatment
starts promptly after evaluation rather than after a time in waiting
list.

To give patients a positive first impression of the treatment, we
suggest that therapists write their first message on the first day of
treatment to welcome the patient and notify them of ways to contact you.
Provide encouragement throughout treatment to motivate the patient and
establish a therapeutic working alliance. Patients sometimes struggle
with crucial treatment components such as the BDD diary exposure with
response prevention (EX/RP), so make sure to provide extra support if
patients get stuck at those points.

\hypertarget{modules-in-bdd-net}{%
\section{Modules in BDD-NET}\label{modules-in-bdd-net}}

Below is an overview of the eight treatment modules. We recommend that
you look at them from a patient's point of view before starting the
first treatment.

As you can see, the emphasis is on doing exposure with response
prevention (EX/RP), which we view as the main component of BDD-NET. You
typically want to encourage the patient to progress through the first
three modules as fast as possible, check that they have understood the
rationale for EX/RP, and then start doing EX/RP. Once a patient is doing
regular EX/RP-exercises, you can open up modules 6-7 for them to
complete while continuing to do daily EX/RP. Module 8 can then be opened
up with one to two weeks left in treatment.

\hypertarget{being-an-effective-icbt-therapist}{%
\chapter{Being an effective ICBT
therapist}\label{being-an-effective-icbt-therapist}}

Being a therapist in internet-based CBT (ICBT) differs in several ways
from regular face-to-face treatment. The first difference is the mode of
communication: asynchronous text messages rather than live face-to-face
talking. The second is that you are more closely integrated in the
treatment content, and will rely more heavily on the written material.
Third, there is less therapist oversight during active ERP exercises. We
will discuss these implications below.

\hypertarget{keep-your-messages-short}{%
\section{Keep your messages short}\label{keep-your-messages-short}}

Messages should be concise and to the point but still using a personal
touch. The main aim here is to provide encouragement and reinforce key
behaviours in the treatment, such as registrations in the OCD/BDD diary
and performing ERP exercises. With this said, please allow yourself also
to write longer messages when needed, for example to highlight examples
in the diary that you think are informative and relate these to the CBT
model of OCD/BDD.

\hypertarget{write-often}{%
\section{Write often}\label{write-often}}

Frequent communication is particularly useful at the start of treatment
and when patients are in the startup phase of ERP. In many ways, ICBT
may be an even more intensive treatment than traditional face-to-face
CBT. Our standard procedure is to contact patients at least twice
weekly, but more often when needed. For example, you may confirm an
exposure exercise in the morning and check in during the afternoon for a
follow-up.

There are exceptions to the rule of frequent messages: some patients
will prefer to do ERP exercises on their own and will not have many
questions for you. This is perfectly fine; some patients benefit greatly
from the ICBT treatment without the therapist support. The default mode,
however, is frequent contact with patients.

\hypertarget{you-and-the-rest-of-the-content-in-icbt}{%
\section{You and the rest of the content in
ICBT}\label{you-and-the-rest-of-the-content-in-icbt}}

As previously mentioned, ICBT is in many ways a high intensity
treatment. Patients not only respond to your messages but also read
module texts, answer homework questions and questionnaires, and fill in
worksheets. The treatment becomes particularly intensive once patients
start performing daily ERP exercises. Thus, what might feel like a
low-intensity treatment from your perspective may actually be very
intensive from the patient's perspective.

\hypertarget{lack-of-therapist-guided-exposure-exercises}{%
\section{Lack of therapist-guided exposure
exercises}\label{lack-of-therapist-guided-exposure-exercises}}

We do not have the privilege of guiding patients through ERP exercises
in ICBT. This means that you will have to focus on the essentials when
giving corrective feedback to the patient. Correcting every little
detail before each exercise will in this context probably be
counter-productive and might in fact confuse the patient. Instead, our
focus is to get the patient going with the ERP exercises. Wrinkles can
be ironed out along the way.

\hypertarget{dealing-with-patients-with-low-engagement}{%
\section{Dealing with patients with low
engagement}\label{dealing-with-patients-with-low-engagement}}

The best way to deal with low engagement is to prevent it from happening
to begin with. Strategies to prevent low engagement may be to 1) write
frequently (especially in the beginning of treatment in order to keep up
momentum), 2) focus on encouragement in your written messages, 3) call
patients promptly if they do not respond to messages, and 4) provide
support and help to patients that struggle with ERP exercises.

If a patient becomes less active on the treatment platform, it does not
necessarily mean that they are not actively working with the treatment
or have given up on the treatment. Some inactive patients are actually
doing a lot of treatment work in their daily life but do not report this
spontaneously to their therapist.

\hypertarget{strategies-when-patients-express-lack-of-time-to-work-on-the-treatment}{%
\subsection{Strategies when patients express lack of time to work on the
treatment}\label{strategies-when-patients-express-lack-of-time-to-work-on-the-treatment}}

One common reason for low engagement is that the patient struggles to
find the time to work on ICBT. We recommend that you encourage any small
steps the patient takes and that you prioritise ERP exercises away from
the computer over reading additional modules.

If a patient is completely unable to work on the treatment right now,
ask him/her if it possible to delay the start of treatment. It is
important to stress that the absolute majority of patients responding to
OCD-NET and BDD-NET experience this gain within the first 5 weeks after
starting treatment. Thus, even if the patient is delayed and start the
treatment at week 5, it is still possible to achieve a significant
improvement given that the patient works with the treatment intensively.

\hypertarget{strategies-when-patients-express-skepticism-about-icbt}{%
\subsection{Strategies when patients express skepticism about
ICBT}\label{strategies-when-patients-express-skepticism-about-icbt}}

Some patients may be a bit skeptical about ICBT in general or in their
ability to complete a remotely-delivered treatment with a therapist at a
distance. We recommend that therapists validate and acknowledge that
this is common early in treatment and, importantly, help these patients
experience \emph{early wins} by starting with swift and easy ERP
exercises.

This being said, it is important to stress that OCD-NET and BDD-NET have
never been designed as full alternatives to face-to-face CBT but should
instead be seen as a complementary approach. Patients who are skeptical
to ICBT from the beginning will probably not benefit from this treatment
modality. Alternative formats and treatments are probably a more
feasible option in these cases.

\hypertarget{use-these-as-well}{%
\section{Use these as well?}\label{use-these-as-well}}

\hypertarget{lack-of-space-to-address-questions-through-messages}{%
\subsection{Lack of space to address questions through
messages}\label{lack-of-space-to-address-questions-through-messages}}

Starting out as a therapist in BDD-NET can be frustrating if you want to
address every question and issue that patients report.

\textbf{IDEAS:} * Focus on one thing per message * Rely on the written
material, common questions are most likely addressed in one of the
modules * Whenever possible, turn it into an exercise that the patient
can try out for themselves. Maybe it's suitable for cognitive
restructuring, maybe an EX/RP exercise. * You can also defer some common
issues to module 7 if it's included there. * We have to accept that we
do not have fine grained control over the patient's understanding. Maybe
that's OK as long as they do EX/RP exercises, then you can steer the
patient toward exercises that might resolve a misunderstanding

\hypertarget{reinforcing-rumination-instead-of-behaviour-change}{%
\subsection{Reinforcing rumination instead of behaviour
change}\label{reinforcing-rumination-instead-of-behaviour-change}}

You can avoid reinforcing the wrong behaviour by thinking about what you
attend to in your responses to patients. A typical message from a
patient mid-treatment might include a summary of their latest EX/RP,
comments about what they have found challenging, and a couple of
questions about the treatment content. It is very tempting to try to
answer the questions and make suggestions for how to deal with the
challenges in your response, but that is not really what we want to
reinforce here. Rather, we want to encourage the patient to continue
doing EX/RP because that is the key behaviour for them to get better in
the long-term.

\textbf{IDEAS:} * Maybe it's already discussed in the ``common
difficulties'' module, then open up that one * Maybe you can recommend a
certain EX/RP exercise for the patient to try and see whether that
resolves their question * Maybe it's lack of clarity in the EX/RP
exercise and you need to revisit the plan, make some changes, and then
try again * We don't want to reinforce rumination over challenges but
rather the patient's ability to do hands-on exercises and adjust them
over time

\hypertarget{technical-support}{%

questions.

\hypertarget{technical-support-for-patients}{%
\section{Technical support for
patients}\label{technical-support-for-patients}}

We have designed the platform to be user-friendly for patients with
varying technical know-how. They will, however, require technical
support from time to time. Here we review the most common issues that
patients might have and how to solve them. If patients report technical
issues that you cannot address yourself, send an email to
\href{mailto:ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}{\nolinkurl{ocdnet.support@webcbt.se}}
and ask for assistance.

\hypertarget{forgotten-username-or-password}{%
\subsection{Forgotten username or
password}\label{forgotten-username-or-password}}

If a patient has forgotten their password, they can request a new one at
the login screen:

\includegraphics{images/patient-lost-password.png}

If they have forgotten their username, simply look at their
\emph{Participant stats} and \textbf{Login} is their username.

If a patient is unable to generate a new password on their own, navigate
to the patient in question and the \emph{Participant stats} tab. There
is a button to clear password or change password, we recommend the
\emph{Change password} option.

\textbf{Clear password:} The password is removed and the user will not
be able to use their previous password. You will have to generate a new
one by clicking \emph{Change password}.

\textbf{Change password:} The site generates a new, secure, password
that you can send to the patient via SMS. You might want to save the new
password as a temporary note (the box below the \emph{Change password}
button) in case the password is lost again.
